# Auto-Refresh Functionality for Ticket Replies

## Overview
This implementation adds automatic page refresh functionality when a reply is sent to a ticket, eliminating the need for manual page refreshes.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Automatic Refresh After Reply
- When a reply is sent successfully, the ticket data is automatically refreshed
- New replies appear immediately without manual page refresh

- **Refresh Indicator**: A blue notification appears in the top-right corner during refresh
- **Latest Reply Highlight**: The most recent reply is highlighted with a green border and "Latest" badge

### 3. Auto-Scroll to Latest Reply
- The page automatically scrolls to the bottom to show the newest reply
- Users can immediately see their sent reply without scrolling
